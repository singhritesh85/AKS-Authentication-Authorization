# AKS Azure AD Authentication with AZURE RBAC

**In this kind of Azure AKS Authentication and Authorization the Authentication of user will be done using Azure AD and it's Authorization will be done using Azure Role Based Access Control (Azure RBAC).**
<br><br/>
I have demonstrated this with the help of creation of two users named as demo-user and admin-user in the groups demo-group and admin-group respectively. The demo-user have only the Read access for pods, services and deployments. While the admin-user have admin access.
