# AKS-Authentication-Authorization

```
There are mainly three Access and Identity Options with AKS
(a) Local Accounts with Kubernetes RBAC
(b) Azure AD authentication with Kubernetes RBAC
(c) Azure AD authentication with Azure RBAC 
```
To demonstrate three types of Accesses I have created the AKS cluster using the terraform script present in my GitHub Repo https://github.com/singhritesh85/terraform-azure and inside the directory azure-aks-withoutmanagedprometheusgrafana
